# DiagnoWise

This web application combines symptom-based disease prediction with an AI medical chatbot, offering a glimpse into AI's potential in healthcare assistance.

## üîç Symptom-Based Disease Prediction

This section allows users to input their symptoms and receive a prediction of the top 3 most likely diseases, along with their descriptions and suggested precautions.

### üîß Backend

* **Dataset Loading:**
    * Loads `dataset.csv`: Contains mappings of symptoms to diseases.
    * Loads `symptom_Description.csv`: Provides descriptions for each disease.
    * Loads `symptom_precaution.csv`: Lists precautions associated with each disease.
* **Model:**
    * Utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** built dynamically upon receiving symptom input.
* **Input:**
    * Users enter their symptoms in a text field, separated by commas (e.g., "itching, skin_rash, fatigue").
* **Processing:**
    1.  The entered symptoms are converted into a binary input vector based on the features present in the `dataset.csv`.
    2.  The trained Random Forest model predicts the top 3 most likely diseases based on this input vector.
    3.  The corresponding descriptions and precautions for the predicted diseases are fetched from `symptom_Description.csv` and `symptom_precaution.csv`.
* **Output:**
    * The backend returns a JSON response containing the top 3 disease predictions. For each prediction, the following information is included:
        * Disease Name
        * Confidence Percentage (representing the model's certainty)
        * Description of the disease
        * Suggested Precautions

### üåê Frontend

* Provides a user-friendly text input field where users can enter their symptoms.
* Sends the entered symptom data to the `/diagnose` endpoint on the backend using an HTTP POST request.
* Upon receiving the JSON response from the backend, the frontend dynamically displays the top 3 disease predictions in a clear and organized manner, showing:
    * The name of each predicted disease.
    * The confidence percentage associated with the prediction.
    * A brief description of the disease.
    * A list of suggested precautions.

## üí¨ AI Medical Chatbot

This section features an AI-powered chatbot that can answer medical questions in natural language.

### üîß Backend

* Leverages **Groq's LLaMA3-70B model** through their API to provide conversational medical assistance.
* When a user sends a message:
    1.  The backend receives the user's prompt.
    2.  It sends this prompt as a message to the Groq API.
    3.  The backend receives the natural language response generated by the LLaMA3-70B model.
* The AI's response is then sent back to the frontend.

### üåê Frontend

* Includes a separate text input box where users can type their medical questions or prompts.
* Sends the user's input to the `/chatbot` endpoint on the backend.
* When the backend responds with the AI's message, it is displayed clearly under the chatbox, creating a conversational flow.

## üß† Bonus Features & Design

* **AI Integration:** Seamless integration with Groq's powerful LLaMA3-70B model for the chatbot functionality.
* **Minimal and Modern UI:** The application features a clean and contemporary user interface built using only standard HTML and CSS, ensuring simplicity and ease of use.
* **Single-Page Application:** Both the symptom diagnosis and the chatbot functionalities are integrated into a single web page for a smooth user experience.
* **Favicon:** Includes a custom favicon designed to visually represent the medical and AI nature of the application, enhancing branding.

## üí° Real-World Use Case

This project serves as a demonstration of an AI-powered medical assistant and highlights potential applications in various scenarios, including:

* **Health Awareness Apps:** Providing users with preliminary insights into their symptoms.
* **First-Level Triage Bots:** Assisting in initial assessments and guiding users on seeking appropriate medical help.
* **Hackathon Demos:** A compelling showcase of AI and machine learning in the healthcare domain.
* **AI/ML Project Showcases:** Demonstrating the implementation of machine learning models and large language models for practical applications.
